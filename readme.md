# KuzuhaScriptPHP+ (くずはすくりぷとPHP+)
An improved version of the PHP port of KuzuhaScript (くずはすくりぷと).
As of 2024/10/16, it only works with PHP8+
Last legacy PHP (from 4.1.0 to 7.4) version can be found here: [https://github.com/Heyuri/ksphp-plus-en/releases/tag/20240710](https://github.com/Heyuri/ksphp-plus-en/releases/tag/20240710)

This program is based on the 2005/04/01 modified version of KuzuhaScriptPHP (くずはすくりぷとPHP) by cion (しおん).

This program has originally been translated to English by [Anonymous-san at Strange World@Heyuri.net](https://ayashii.net/bbs.php?c=08&m=tree&ff=202205.dat&s=3555) and several anonymous developers from Heyuri have contributed to it since.

## Installation process (for reference only)
1. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file
2. Open and configure conf.php
3. Upload the files to the server using an FTP client or similar (it's a good idea to create a dedicated directory so that it doesn't get mixed up with other files)
4. Set the permissions as described in readme.md
5. Open a web browser, access bbs.php, and set the administrator password
6. Open your local conf.php file, paste the admin password generated in step 6 to 'ADMINPOST' => 'here' on line 36, then upload the file using your FTP client to overwrite it
7. Open your web browser, go to bbs.php, and see if you can post
8. Access the URL where the log files (bbs.log, files inside log/, etc.) are located using a web browser, and check if you can see it (if you can see it, please hide it with .htaccess, etc.)

## Recommended permission settings
Incorrect permissions can cause problems and data leaks (such as a post's IP address or remote host), so please make sure that they are set correctly.

```

    |-- phpzip.inc.php  644 (read-only)     ZIP file creation library
```

If PHP runs as an Apache module, bbs.php will run as read-only, 
but if it runs as CGI, bbs.php needs to be set to 755 (executable).
